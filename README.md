*`CGIJS` is a library to run any `CGI` mode / `Interpreted language script` files, or connect to any web application server proxies, or manage processes in the system.*



`CGIJS` library:

- Supports running any `CGI` / `Interpreted Language scripts` in `any OS` that runs `node.js`.
- Supports both `CGI` executables as well as `proxy` to `localhost`/ `remote` /`embedded servers` using proxying of multiple protocols (`http`, `websockets`, `tcp`, `udp`, `socks`, `ssh`, `ftp`).
- Supports managing processes like `embedded` `server` executables, embedded `database` executables, or `any other` embedded/ non-embedded executables 


`[Funding Invited]`


*General Note: The library is production ready. However, please be cautious of processes/executables permissions/security in your project using CGIJS*


# History

CGIJS was created with a motivation to allow creation of a `Desktop executable/ application` using `Electron` that can run any `CGI` / `Interpreted language scripted files/ applications` under the hood. 


[![Desktop CGI](./desktop-cgi.jpeg)](https://github.com/desktop-cgi/desktop-cgi)


# Installation

```
npm install cgijs --save
```



# Features

*Light weight, Flexible, Generic implementation. CGIJS is Nodejs `Framework Independent / agnostic` for application development.*


There are three main modules inside CGIJS - `file` for CGI file execution, `proxy` for running proxies, and `process` for managing processes.



#### **SECURITY NOTE**:


- The process shell module is security agnostic and is dependant on your code.
    - The package accesses the shell to run script executables using the node.js process module. Please consider your `security risks based on your executable's/ script's security risks`.
- The proxy module is security agnostic and is dependant on your code.
    - The `package has a LAN or WAN network proxy module AND does not create any proxies` by its own - unless specified by you. Please consider your custom created proxy's security risks.
- The `package does not use Telemetry, nor Collect data Remotely, nor has Telemetry/Remote based Error collection` on its own.
    - The package propogates errors for you to handle or collect errors/ data.
